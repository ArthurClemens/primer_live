# PrimerLive

An implementation of GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/design) for Phoenix LiveView.

Primer Design provides a strong base for creating data driven applications such as rich CRUD applications with interactive forms.

All PrimerLive components accept the `class` attribute for customisations (and often the `classes` struct to address inner elements). [Primer's utility classes](https://primer.style/design/foundations/css-utilities/getting-started) allow a wide range of customisations without having to write custom styles.

PrimerLive components can be used in [Phoenix LiveView pages](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) and regular (non-LiveView) views in Phoenix applications.

Forms created with [Ash Framework](https://www.ash-hq.org/) are supported.
